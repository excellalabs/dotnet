# [.NET at Excella](https://www.excella.com/services/software-development)

At Excella, we strive for XP practices and modern software techniques such as TDD and continuous delivery (CD), and that's no different within our .NET practice. We have been ramping up on .NET Core for over 2 years & have put it in production. We are strong advocates of it as it jives with open source standards and tools more, and is easier to integrate into any ecosystem.

We're also strong in function via F#, and SPA-based apps whether with various front-end frameworks.

We have followed the trend from Microsoft in becoming more and more polyglot on our .NET projects, leveraging things from PostgreSQL to AWS & Linux Docker containers. We see this as a very positive trend, making a very bright future where .NET can live anywhere easily, not just in Windows environmnets.
